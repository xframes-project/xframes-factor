# xframes-factor

## Notes

This demo app works but it is kinda brittle. I have never seen anything a programming language quite like Factor, probably the most unique language I'ever come across so far.

## Instructions

### Installing Factor

#### Ubuntu

Download binaries from https://builds.factorcode.org/release?os=linux&cpu=x86.64

run `sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module libgtkglext1-dev`

`factor main.factor`

## Screenshots

Ubuntu 24.04
